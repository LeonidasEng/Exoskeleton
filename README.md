<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
ASTM International’s Exo Technology Center of Excellence (ET CoE) is sponsoring the Exo Games, a new initiative to improve student involvement and education in the exo technologies industry.

The Exo Games is a competition open to university teams of S.T.E.M degree students, designed to connect them with exo industry professionals, help them build lifelong relationships, and get hands-on experience with new exo standards.  Team slots are on a first come first served basis and ASTM reserves the right to limit the number of teams due to space and logistic considerations."

Working in teams, students must design, build, and test a self-contained exoskeleton from a project specification provided to them. From this specification they must produce a design solution, make it, test it with the predefined ASTM standards, and compete to win a grand prize. The Games will be hosted by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in Lancashire, England.

Each team can use just one exoskeleton device at the competition, but all students who work on the challenge will benefit from the learning experience of applying their technical knowledge. The competition has four main areas for the teams to excel:

⋅⋅1. Main Competition - Design, build and test an exo technology device to compete with other teams.

⋅⋅2. Design Competition - Create a virtual prototype of your device.

⋅⋅3. Poster Competition - Produce a poster to publicize the teams’ work. The poster is a demonstration of the team’s ability to sell their design solution pictorially.

⋅⋅4. Presentation Competition - Give a short presentation explaining the design and development of their device to demonstrate their verbal & presentational skills.
